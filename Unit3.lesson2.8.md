Monte Hall is a famous problem in Conditional probability.  The important issues to remember
is that the host will never reveal your door and will never reveal the car.  Thus the prior probability
is that each door has 1/3 prob. of a car.  After he opens one of the doors essentially 2/3 probability of
the other doors has now been revealed as residing in the other door.  You should switch.  The risk is that
you chose correctly originally.  The underlying idea is that Monte's actions have revealed information.
