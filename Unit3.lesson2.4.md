1. The events (flips) are independent so each sequence has the probability .5**4 = 0.0625
2. Prob of not choosing a man is 1- prob(coosing a man) = 24/45
3. Multiply both prob of flying times probability of plane crash = .005% * 10% = .0005%
4. You are more likely to survey people who browse your website longer.  You are likely overestimating average time 
users are staying.
