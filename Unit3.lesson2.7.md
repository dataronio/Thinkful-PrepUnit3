1. We are looking at AirBnB data taken on Christmas Eve.  This data is likely to be biased as it is a popular holiday.
Get data randomly sampled throughout the year.

2. This is again being biased as it is one day after a terrorist attack on 9/11.  People in NYC are likely
to feel greater effects possibly than people in San Francisco.

3. It looks like an online survey.  Again this might bias results against people who do not do much
online activity.  Older Armenians might not be as willing to respond.
