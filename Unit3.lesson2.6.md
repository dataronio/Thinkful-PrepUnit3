1. Prob(test is positive) = .98*.005 + .1*.995 = .1044
2. prob (+|D) = .98 - This is given in the problem
3. prob (-|~D) = 1 - prob(+|~D) = 1 - .1 = .9
4. misclassification = 1 - prob(correct classification) = 1 - (prob(+|D)*Prob(D) + prob(-|~D)*prob(~D))) = 1 - (.98*.005 + .9*.995) = 1 - .9004  = .0996
